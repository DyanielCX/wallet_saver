## 🤖 Vibe-coded project

This project was **vibe-coded** — built conversationally with an AI coding agent rather than hand-written line by line.

- **Built with:** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Anthropic's agentic coding CLI
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.8 (`claude-opus-4-8`)
- **How:** Architecture, Flutter/Dart implementation, and this documentation were generated through an iterative chat-driven workflow.

# Wallet Saver

**Wallet Saver** is a lightweight, offline-first personal finance app for tracking day-to-day income and expenses. Everything lives on-device — no account, no cloud sync, no network dependency. Log transactions in seconds, watch your budgets, and review where the money goes.

## Features

- **Transactions** — record income and expenses against categories, with notes, dates, and a built-in calculator keypad for quick amount entry.
- **Categories** — ships with sensible defaults (Food, Transport, Groceries, Salary, …) and supports your own custom categories with emoji icons.
- **Budgets** — set monthly or overall spending limits per category and track usage against them.
- **Recurring transactions** — define templates (e.g. rent, salary, subscriptions) that auto-generate transactions when they come due, with catch-up on app launch.
- **Reports** — visual breakdowns of spending and income over time, powered by charts.
- **CSV import/export** — back up or move your data via the device file picker; flexible column mapping on import.
- **Local notifications** — reminders surfaced through the OS notification system.

## Architecture

Wallet Saver follows a pragmatic, layered structure under `lib/`. The UI talks to a thin service/data layer; a single `DatabaseHelper` is the only access point to SQLite.

**Navigation.** A single `MainScaffold` hosts a `NavigationBar` with four tabs — **Transactions**, **Reports**, **Budgets**, **Settings** — each backed by its own screen.

**Data flow.** Screens call into `services/` (or directly into `DatabaseHelper` for reads). `DatabaseHelper` is a singleton that owns the SQLite connection, defines the schema (`categories`, `transactions`, `budgets`, `recurring_templates`), handles versioned migrations, and seeds default categories on first run. Models are simple immutable classes that serialize to/from `Map` for storage.

**Startup.** `main()` initializes the notification plugin and runs `RecurringService.processDue()` so any recurring transactions that fell due while the app was closed are created before the first frame.

## Getting Started

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Requires the Flutter SDK (stable channel). The app runs on Android, iOS, web, and desktop targets, though it's designed primarily for mobile.
